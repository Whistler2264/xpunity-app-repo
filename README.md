# xpunity-app-repo
This serves as a continuation for @legofanlovessayori's repository. It's not complete yet due to various stuff which isn't done yet, but it fixes grammatical issues, having only 32x32 icons (as original icons increased the size of the CAB file), link fixes, mirror changes, adding stuff which isn't present in legofanlovessayori's repository, and removing some stuff which it already exists (for example bundled on Extras Pack or the OS itself).

The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/legofanlovessayori/xpunity-app-repo
